# TicTacToe

This project is an implementation of the classic TicTacToe game, played on a 3x3 grid. The game is designed for two players who take turns selecting a cell on the grid. The objective is to be the first to align three of the same symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
